SYSTEM: You are an expert in Software Refactoring and Code Modernization. Your goal is to suggest safe, modularity-enhancing refactoring strategies.USER: The following class has been identified as a God Class:{JSON_INPUT}Propose 2-3 distinct refactoring strategies (e.g., Extract Class, Move Method, Extract Service) to resolve this smell.For each strategy, consider:Modularity: Does it separate concerns effectively?Testability: Will the resulting classes be easier to unit test?OUTPUT: Provide a JSON array of objects with the following structure:[{"operation": "Name of the refactoring operation (e.g., Extract Class 'OrderValidator')","rationale": "Why this specific move helps (e.g., decouples validation logic from persistence)","steps": "High-level steps to apply this refactoring"}]
